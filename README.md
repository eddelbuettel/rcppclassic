## RcppClassic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eddelbuettel/rcppclassic.png)](https://travis-ci.org/eddelbuettel/rcppclassic)

The RcppClassic package provides a (now deprecated) C++ library which
facilitates the integration of R and C++. 

New projects should use the new [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org) API in the
[Rcpp package](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp).

### Status

The package is still maintained in order to provided backwards-compatibility.
However, users of the package are *strongly* encouraged to migrated to the
[Rcpp package](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) package.

### Authors

Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois, with contributions by David Reiss,
and based on code written during 2005 and 2006 by Dominick Samperi
